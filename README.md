# RKM
Reduced K means alogithm is an enhanced version of the K means clustering alogorithm.
This project is build for Wireless sensor Networks. 
The wireless sensors are non movable and placed in areas which humans cannot go frequently. So the power in them is a primary convern as they cannot be charged once deployed.
So we move the receiver in such a way that we get informcation from the sensor when receiver is near to it. 
This projects shows
  1. How to sensors should divide themselves into clusters?
  2. How to select a head point(like head node in LEACH)
  3. What path should receiver travel to collect information from sensors.

This entire simulation is made in MATLAB. At the end you will get a set of images with clear understand how a packet is getting transmitted and comparision between original approach and new approach.
